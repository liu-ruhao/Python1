                             universal approximation theorem

1) this is a simple demo in which we use a mlp neural network to learn the non-linear relation between input_x and label_y.
2) the data, input_x and label_y, is generated from a given non-linear mathematical relation manually.
3) we show that more layers each with non-linear activate function and large number of nodes behaves good in the simple demo.


run  'python main.py' to start the program
by editing the file 'config.py', one can set different parameters such as the learning rate, the batch size.
